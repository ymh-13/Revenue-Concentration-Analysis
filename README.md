# Revenue-Concentration-Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes **revenue concentration** in an online retail dataset to understand how revenue is distributed across **customers and products**. The goal is to identify business risk from over-reliance on a small subset of high-value customers or best-selling products and to generate data-driven insights.

This is a **personal data scienc projects** completed to gain hands-on experience with real-world transactional data beyond coursework.

## Key-Questions
- what percentage of total revenue is generated by the **top customers**?
- How concentrated is revenue among **products**?
- How does revenue concentration change **over time**?
- What business risks arise from high revenue concentration?

## Dataset
- **Source:** Online Retail Transaction Dataset
- **Description:** This is a transactional dataset containing all transactions occuring between **01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011** for a **UK-based, registered, non-store online retail business**.
- **Contents:** Invoice numbers, product codes and descriptions, quantities, unit prices, customer IDs, countries, and transaction timestamps
- **Size:** ~540,000 transactions

## Methods and Analysis 
- Data cleaning and preprocessing (handling, missing CustomerID values)
- Feature engineering (revenue calculation, monthly aggregation)
- Revenue aggregation by:
  - Customer
  - Product
  - Month
- Revenue concentration analysis using:
  - Revenue share by percentile (top 1%, 5%, 10%)
  - Cumulative revenue distributions
  - **Lorenz curves** to visualize inequality
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization in Python

## Key Findings
- A **small percentage of customers** contributes a disproportionately large share of total revenue.
- Revenue is also highly concentrated among a **small subset of products**.
- Concentration remains persistently high over time, indicating exposure to churn and demand risk.

## Business Insights
- Heavy reliance on top customers increases revenue volatility.
- Best selling products require careful inventory and demand planning.
- Diversifying the customer base and product portfolio may improve long-term stability.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- pandas, NumPy
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook
